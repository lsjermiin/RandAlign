PURPOSE     RandAlign reads a multiple sequence alignment and then shuffles the content across:

              1. sites within each sequence [retains entropy of each sequence];
              2. sequences within each site [retains entropy of each site];
              3. sites as well as sequences.
              
            The resulting two alignments are printed to two files.
 
FORMAT      Sequences must be stored in the FASTA format.
 
DATA TYPES  nucleotides, 10-state genotypes, 14-state genotypes and amino acids.

COMPILE     g++ randalign.cpp -o randalign -O2 -Wall

HELP        Simply type randalign in the command line
